* ZuseNEAT
** Overview
   This is a / will be my 2nd implementation of the NEAT Algorithm,
   and this time it's in C++17. My prior NEAT implementation was in
   pure Ruby, and was more a proof of concept than anything. ZuseNEAT
   shall be much more powerful.

   I have much planned here, but no promises. You'll know when the
   coolness is implemented.
*** Why Zuse?
    Konrad Zuse invented the world's first digital computer. This man

    Today, we have moved far beyond his humble initial creation, the Z1,
    which was entirely mechanical. History has almost forgotten him,
    and so I name this NEAT implementation after him in honer of his
    accomplishments.
